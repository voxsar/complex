- `PATCH /api/payment-methods/:id/default` - Set payment method as default
- `GET /api/admin/payment-methods` - Admin endpoint to manage all payment methods

### 4. Webhook Processing
- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` - Stripe webhook endpoint with signature verification
- `POST /api/webhooks/paypal` - PayPal webhook endpoint with signature verification
- `GET /api/webhooks/events` - View webhook events for debugging

### Documentation
- `PAYMENT_INTEGRATION_API.md` - Complete API documentation
- `.env.payment-example` - Environment variable example

### Updated Files

- `package.json` - Added Stripe and PayPal dependencies

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install stripe @paypal/paypal-server-sdk axios
npm install --save-dev @types/stripe
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Copy `.env.payment-example` to `.env` and configure:
```env
# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# PayPal  
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
```

### 3. Start Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Endpoints
The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with all payment endpoints ready to use.

## üß™ Testing

### Stripe Test Cards
- **Success**: `4242424242424242`
- **Decline**: `4000000000000002` 
- **3D Secure**: `4000002500003155`

### PayPal Testing
Use PayPal's sandbox environment with test credentials.

### Webhook Testing
Use ngrok for local webhook testing:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
# Configure webhook URLs in gateway dashboards
```

## üîê Security Features

- JWT authentication for all endpoints
- Webhook signature verification
- Rate limiting protection
